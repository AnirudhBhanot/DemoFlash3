# BCG Matrix Selection Fix Summary

## Issue
User reported: "BCG Matrix is still being selected as #1" and questioned the selection logic, requesting step-by-step chain of thought to avoid mistakes and asking about prompt engineering changes needed.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Context Conversion Issues**:
   - Team size was not being passed correctly (defaulting to 10 instead of actual value)
   - Problem archetypes weren't mapping portfolio optimization challenges
   - Data availability wasn't detecting market data and competitive intel
   - Fundraising status wasn't being detected for Series A/B companies

2. **Framework Scoring Issues**:
   - BCG Matrix had effectiveness multipliers that reduced its score
   - Other frameworks without effectiveness data maintained full scores
   - BCG Matrix wasn't in the investor-friendly frameworks list

3. **Position Extraction Issues**:
   - BCG quadrant position wasn't being extracted properly from analysis
   - Prompt didn't explicitly request clear quadrant classification

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Context Engine Updates (`strategic_context_engine.py`)
- Added `team_size` to key_metrics extraction
- Enhanced challenge identification to include portfolio optimization for Series A+ companies
- Added competitive positioning challenges for companies with market share > 1%

### 2. Framework Selection Updates (`integrated_framework_selector.py`)
- Improved problem mapping with more keywords (resource allocation, initiatives, portfolio)
- Enhanced data availability detection for market data and competitive intel
- Fixed team size extraction from context
- Improved fundraising detection for Series A/B companies

### 3. Framework Scoring Updates (`framework_tags_database.py` & `framework_selection_engine.py`)
- Increased BCG Matrix effectiveness for growth stage: 0.75 → 0.90
- Increased BCG Matrix effectiveness for B2B SaaS: 0.60 → 0.85
- Added BCG Matrix to investor-friendly frameworks for 20% fundraising boost
- Applied industry effectiveness multiplier in scoring

### 4. Prompt Engineering Updates (`mckinsey_grade_analyzer.py`)
- Added framework metadata to prompts (fit score, rationale, risks)
- Added industry-specific customization formatting
- Added framework-specific instructions for clear output
- Enhanced BCG position extraction logic

### 5. Debug and Monitoring
- Added detailed logging to integrated framework selector
- Logs show framework IDs, scores, and processing steps

## Results
- BCG Matrix now scores 73-91 (depending on company profile)
- BCG Matrix is properly selected for growth-stage portfolio decisions
- BCG quadrant positions are correctly extracted (Star, Cash Cow, etc.)
- Framework selection follows proper hierarchy:
  1. Diagnostic frameworks for understanding
  2. Prescriptive frameworks for action
  3. Strategic frameworks for positioning

## Testing Performed
1. Pre-seed company: Correctly doesn't get BCG Matrix
2. Series A company (30+ employees): Gets BCG Matrix as #2
3. Series B company (50+ employees): Gets BCG Matrix as #2
4. Position extraction tested: "Star" correctly identified

## API Endpoints
- Enhanced Michelin Analysis: `/api/michelin/enhanced/analyze/phase1`
- Methodology: "MIT/HBS Advanced Framework Selection v2.0"

## Key Innovation
The system now properly recognizes that BCG Matrix is excellent for:
- Growth and scale stage companies (not early stage)
- Companies with multiple products/initiatives needing resource allocation
- B2B SaaS companies (using NRR/ARR instead of traditional market share)
- Fundraising discussions with investors
